At VISO, we’re always searching for ways to innovate. Whether in our groundbreaking custom lighting designs, our company culture, or our business strategies, we know that being better is the only way forward.

That’s where you come in

As our new Business Analyst, you’ll be responsible for a range of financial duties: things like reporting, data management, costing and analysis.

A big part of this role involves working with our new ERP software, EPICOR. Here you’ll manage end to end business processes, and identify, define, and analyze business requirements. You’ll also support our software transition by being a resource for EPICOR, and contribute to change and product management.

Succeeding in this role means always looking forward to new opportunities, whether that involves improving our systems for efficiency, finding new applications, or furthering our business goals.

Business analysis is an integral role in our company, and you’ll learn all about our core operations as you gain experience with us. If you can deliver on and exceed the expectations of this role, there will be plenty of chances to grow into more senior positions and responsibilities.

Along with relevant experience, we’re seeking someone who:

Takes initiative – you have the drive and independence to finish projects and tasks on your own, and know how to meet deadlines.
Loves learning – constant improvement is your motto: you are an innovator who’s always looking for a better way.
Excels in group settings – you’re as good with people as you are with analysis, and can use strong interpersonal skills to collaborate with anyone who can lend a hand.
Thinks creatively – you’re strategic and excel in problem solving. You aren’t afraid to try different approaches, and know how to switch tactics when things aren’t working.

What You’ll Need To Succeed
Growth Mindset : This is competitive leadership. Taking the lead in the market place versus following. It's a positive attitude about the company's future — glass half-full —but it's realistic. It's passion for winning. Winning defined as gaining market share. It's placing a fresh emphasis on innovation — challenging the status quo.
Consumer and Customer Focus : This is purpose-driven leadership. It's externally focused — on consumers, on customers. First take care of consumers and customers; financial performance will follow. It's a heightened passion for the consumer: “I firmly believe in improving the lives of consumers.” It's bringing the voice of the consumer and the customer into everything we do. It's seeing our brands through their eyes.
Bias for action: This is action-driven leadership: ""This is what I will do."" It's speed and sense of urgency in making decisions. But it needs to be thoughtful action, intelligent risk-taking. Also it's not wasting time on bureaucracy — it’s output that counts. And it’s simplifying my agenda, carefully choosing priorities — and not taking on too much.
Accountability and Responsibility : This is performance-driven leadership. ""I will deliver against KPIs, holding myself to the highest standards.” I will also hold other people accountable — first by setting clear expectations and then by telling them if they are on the right path. It's staring reality in the eye — doing it with numbers.

It's giving people plenty of room to do their part, and recognizing them for their contributions. It's investing in people's development — giving them feedback and challenging work.

You
---

You are someone who enjoys working in a highly collaborative environment. Our project teams can include PMs, designers, engineers, data scientists and other roles - and pairing across these specialties leads to incredible results.

You can't get enough of product and learning. Our clients come from nearly every vertical out there and you'll be able to work hand-in-hand with the decision makers in each. In fact, you will be partnering directly with a client PM and coaching them on modern product development practices.

You enjoy being a leader and an influencer. In this role, you will work with the project team, client executives and the entire spectrum of PMs (project, product, program and any similar roles that a client may have) - to progress the goal of shipping the right product to the client's users.

This means that we don't just help our clients ship features, or define and validate product direction. We do what needs to be done to ensure that both the product and the engagement are successful.

You are comfortable with ambiguity. We work in an iterative and incremental way, balancing many different inputs and constantly making trade-offs. This requires us to be comfortable moving forward with imperfect information.

The Government of Canada would like to help attract and develop women to grow their careers within the technology landscape, with jobs and opportunities for career advancement across a broad range of specializations, throughout Canada and internationally.
The Government of Canada offers meaningful and influential careers with opportunities to work on social, technological and economic topics that matter to Canadians.

Introduction

According to eMarketer, eCommerce is the only trillion-dollar industry experiencing double-digit year-over-year growth. In 2012, global eCommerce sales topped a trillion dollars for the first time ($1.1 trillion). If estimates are accurate by 2018 eCommerce will grow to $2.49 trillion. These figures alone are compelling, however coupled with the US Census Bureau’s estimate that only 7% of retail sales are currently done online leads us to believe that the eCommerce industry will be a dynamic, lucrative market for many years to come.

Tenzing Managed IT Services is a privately-held, managed hosting company founded in 1998. Tenzing specializes in hosting comprehensive enterprise-class eCommerce, software-as-a-service, and other enterprise Web applications. The Company’s key differentiators include its expertise and focus around managed services supporting leading eCommerce software platforms such as Oracle Commerce, Intershop, Hybris, Magento, and Websphere. Based on Tenzing’s experience hosting multiple eCommerce customers and in collaboration with SI partners, Tenzing has developed a set of reference architectures to standardize configurations which now also leverages asset-free deployments including Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Tenzing is capitalizing on two major market trends that are starting to intersect which is the growth in enterprise eCommerce/merchant applications and the growth in public cloud platform consumption. In the past 18 months Tenzing has been winning extensively with US merchants and 2015 represented a pivotal year smashing previous “new contract sales” records in the company with the majority of them on strategy. Tenzing has progressively moved away from generalist managed service offerings and this role will be challenged to help shape a scalable infrastructure organization to sustain the accelerated growth.

570,Product Manager (Workshops),HackerYou,"Toronto, ON",4 days ago,"Toronto, ONAbout the Position

We’re looking for a creative, energetic and proactive Product Manager to join our team at HackerYou. For this role, you must know HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, and you should be obsessed with creating engaging experiences, because experiences are our “products”! In this role, you’ll think about every single aspect of a student’s experience with workshops at HackerYou, from the moment they sign up to their experience post-workshop. You'll spend a lot of time on workshop curriculum design, making improvements to our existing workshops and also working with developers and other professionals in the tech industry to create the new workshops our community is asking for. In addition, you’ll be intensely focused on the collection of data and feedback so that you can appropriately prioritize changes (we want data to back up your “gut feelings”). We want to ensure that we are creating the most impactful, thoughtful, and enjoyable learning experiences in the whole world - and that’s why we need you!

Ultimately, you will be responsible for all aspects (curriculum, instructors as well as student experience) of all of our workshops (with the exception of the ones we run for free). We have huge plans for workshops at HackerYou for this year and beyond, and in this role there is the potential to directly impact over a thousand students a year. Though you'll only create and lead some of our workshops each year (many more will be led by others), you'll need to be very comfortable being at the front of the room because you'll also help instruct our Accelerated Web Development and JavaScript courses.

Reporting to our Director of Continuing Education, you will be an integral member of HackerYou’s 25-ish person team. We’re a close-knit and passionate team, and it’s important to us that everyone who joins us fits with our core values: 1) We are welcoming, 2) We care deeply about people, 3) We do what's right, 4) We are always improving, and 5) We have fun! If those values resonate with you, please...read on!

This role is ideal for a developer with two to three years of experience looking to make the switch into Product Management or build upon their developer skills by gaining some experience in a new area of technology. It’s also perfect for someone who has discovered a passion for teaching and mentoring, or for someone who wants to start their own business one day - this role will give you the chance to learn a whole bunch about startups, small businesses, technology and education while contributing to a team that really cares about what we do every day. Please note that we don’t care at all about things like degrees or diplomas. We care about finding great people to join our team, and then helping them to reach their full potential!

Developing (or working with others to develop) new workshops based on the content our community is asking for
Creating brand new and highly creative exercises for our workshops (and working with our designers to ensure they’re remarkably beautiful!)
Creating methods for collecting indicators of workshop quality
Ensuring those who participate in our workshops are so passionate about their experiences that they want to leave reviews (and being comfortable asking them to!)
Instructing one evening or weekend Web Development or JavaScript program per calendar year (to ensure you’re always familiar with our offerings!)
Lead or co-lead Accelerated Web Development and Accelerated JavaScript courses throughout the year
Collaborating with the Head of Continuing Education, our CTO and the Bootcamp Team to ensure workshop curriculum is complementary to our other programs
Ensuring the HackerYou Instructor and Mentor Community is kept up-to-date about new workshops
Managing and marking Technical Challenges from students looking to join our workshops without completing prerequisites
Creating training documents and materials to ensure that every time we run a workshop, it’s at the highest level of quality
Contributing to the development and maintenance of HackerYou’s website and web applications
Your Qualifications

You are insanely creative and can come up with awesome ideas for making workshops, curriculum and even education in general way better than the status quo
You would be comfortable leading a group through lessons on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React best practices
You have a track record of getting things done
You are comfortable using Google Docs, Sheets and Slides

You spend your life online – you are a social native – but you are also a huge fan of culture across a range of subjects and in touch with what's happening offline and how that can impact the social space. You know how and when to start conversations, as well as when to participate and when to just listen.

You speak through pictures, animated GIFs, emojis, short videos, memes, and capture content with everything you do. But you also understand how to speak from the perspective of a brand's voice, not your own – and in fact can switch between brands seamlessly.

TASKS

Engage with fans, influencers, and publications multiple times a day. Not just answering questions, but creating moments that will garner press and extend brand love with faves, RTs, shares, etc.
Identify daily, quick-turnaround reactive opportunities — throw lots of ideas at the wall each day with the agency & client teams and see what sticks
Identify & track larger ideas that are not necessarily reactive, but based on observations in the community, as well as contribute to a running list of brand-centric behaviors
Be an integral part of brainstorming for larger campaigns, bringing the audience perspective to all ideas
Create excitement and proactively participate on our client's social media platform
Develop, organize, prioritize, schedule and manage content with the client and internal team across all platforms

Attend and cover key events to create content for the platforms
Foster relationships with influencers
Work closely with creative teams to identify opportunities for innovation and drive press coverage

Sense of humour, good insight for jokes, obsessed with culture. The kind of person who can create a fake profile for a character and fully make that funny, intuitive about being funny for fans without offending
While this is mostly a creative job, a good head for analytics and organization is necessary to drive actionable insights from social listening reports
Ability to work in an agile manner
Ability to create content/editorial calendars for content planning purposes

You'll coach others to deliver amazing work, build relationships with customers, and foster a strong technology culture.

It's a tall, incredibly rewarding order.


About You


Alongside our Client Services and Design leaders, here is how you'll spend your time:
50% - Build strategic relationships with new customers, help define customer technology strategy and vision, and scope & pitch our work together, contributing directly toward our quarterly bookings objectives.

What this Role is NOT
A traditional 'approve everything' engineering manager role.
A management role which is fully unbilled; i.e. you'll still have some time allocated to direct involvement in a few projects as a technology leader.
Is the role a fit for you?


The Associate Director, Voice and AI Professional Services role emphasizes team collaboration, technology strategy and business acumen, as well as functional leadership in your area of expertise. We value leaders with a maker's attitude, collaborative energy, and entrepreneurial spirit. You'll find fulfillment in the role if you
Delight in making things. You thrill at the concept of helping teams deliver a concrete product, not merely a strategy or concept. You have an eye for detail and know how to get the highest performance out of technologists. You've got a solid handle on building enterprise web and mobile applications.
Find passion in learning new things. You relish every opportunity to move things forward with your can-do attitude and you eagerly share your entrepreneurial spark. You like depth, but if you only have time to skim the surface, you can get up to speed quickly and think critically about what you've learned.
Thoroughly enjoy collaborative work and servant leadership. You enjoy knowledge sharing in all directions and you geek out at the chance to improve skills across disciplines for you and your teammates. You genuinely care about what makes people tick, and you're committed to helping others succeed by putting the team's needs first.
You have an interest in making the business work. You're an entrepreneur at heart. You see technology as a tool that can solve business challenges. You're willing to wear different hats to move the business forward.
Qualifications
A college or university degree in a related discipline preferable.
Demonstrated ability to scope, pitch and close business with enterprise customers.
Minimum 7 - 10 years industry experience in enterprise web and mobile development with a minimum of 3 years in a leadership role.
Demonstrated background with voice interfaces (frameworks such as Alexa Skills Kit, Google Dialogflow or MS Bot Framework) or creation of custom Conversational AI
Ideally experience managing teams using a modern technology stack, including cloud infrastructure, full-stack JavaScript and using agile project delivery methodologies.
Ability to travel to meet customers, partners and our community (10-25%).
Performance & Growth Expectations
Your work as a technology team leader will be measured using our 360-degree system (a combination of peer and supervisor feedback) and through evaluation of responsibility fulfilment.
Your growth path in your functional domain will be primarily your own responsibility to define, based on what you hope to achieve and how you choose to access the resources available to you.
Your work will also be measured on the basis of a semi-annual KPI set cooperatively with our leadership team.
Benefits & Perks
Explore ongoing opportunities for professional development: training, conferences, certifications, and in-house peer mentorship.
Experiment with new techniques, wear multiple hats, and learn about new disciplines. Our environment is not your average, hierarchical software studio: we emphasize accountability for outcomes, but autonomy in activities.
Pursue independent projects, explore new ideas, and challenge yourself to become a thought leader in your field with 5 days of dedicated ""Awesome time"" (self-directed professional development) annually.
Enjoy a flexible schedule of full-time hours, health/dental benefits and private US coverage.
Work from a modern, ergonomic space complete with standing/sitting desks and an open-concept social atmosphere.

We are searching for an Associate Director of Voice and AI Professional Services to lead our teams working with Google, Amazon, IBM and other emerging Voice and Artificial Intelligence partners.

You'll coach others to deliver amazing work, build relationships with customers, and foster a strong technology culture. You'll work as a member of our Extended Leadership Team to grow accounts and win new business. You'll wear various hats and let your entrepreneurial spirit fly (or run, or swim, or teleport...) It's a tall, incredibly rewarding order.

About You

Alongside our Client Services and Design leaders, here is how you'll spend your time:


50% - Build strategic relationships with new customers, help define customer technology strategy and vision, and scope & pitch our work together, contributing directly toward our quarterly bookings objectives.

What this Role is NOT


A traditional 'approve everything' engineering manager role.
A management role which is fully unbilled; i.e. you'll still have some time allocated to direct involvement in a few projects as a technology leader.

Is the role a fit for you?

The Associate Director, Voice and AI Professional Services role emphasizes team collaboration, technology strategy and business acumen, as well as functional leadership in your area of expertise. We value leaders with a maker's attitude, collaborative energy, and entrepreneurial spirit. You'll find fulfillment in the role if you…


Delight in making things. You thrill at the concept of helping teams deliver a concrete product, not merely a strategy or concept. You have an eye for detail and know how to get the highest performance out of technologists. You've got a solid handle on building enterprise web and mobile applications.
Find passion in learning new things. You relish every opportunity to move things forward with your can-do attitude and you eagerly share your entrepreneurial spark. You like depth, but if you only have time to skim the surface, you can get up to speed quickly and think critically about what you've learned.
Thoroughly enjoy collaborative work and servant leadership. You enjoy knowledge sharing in all directions and you geek out at the chance to improve skills across disciplines for you and your teammates. You genuinely care about what makes people tick, and you're committed to helping others succeed by putting the team's needs first.
You have an interest in making the business work. You're an entrepreneur at heart. You see technology as a tool that can solve business challenges. You're willing to wear different hats to move the business forward.

Qualifications


A college or university degree in a related discipline preferable.
Demonstrated ability to scope, pitch and close business with enterprise customers.
Minimum 7 - 10 years industry experience in enterprise web and mobile development with a minimum of 3 years in a leadership role.
Demonstrated background with voice interfaces (frameworks such as Alexa Skills Kit, Google Dialogflow or MS Bot Framework) or creation of custom Conversational AI
Ideally experience managing teams using a modern technology stack, including cloud infrastructure, full-stack JavaScript and using agile project delivery methodologies.
Ability to travel to meet customers, partners and our community (10-25%).

Performance & Growth Expectations


Your work as a technology team leader will be measured using our 360-degree system (a combination of peer and supervisor feedback) and through evaluation of responsibility fulfilment.
Your growth path in your functional domain will be primarily your own responsibility to define, based on what you hope to achieve and how you choose to access the resources available to you.
Your work will also be measured on the basis of a semi-annual KPI set cooperatively with our leadership team.

Benefits & Perks


Explore ongoing opportunities for professional development: training, conferences, certifications, and in-house peer mentorship.
Experiment with new techniques, wear multiple hats, and learn about new disciplines. Our environment is not your average, hierarchical software studio: we emphasize accountability for outcomes, but autonomy in activities.
Pursue independent projects, explore new ideas, and challenge yourself to become a thought leader in your field with 5 days of dedicated ""Awesome time"" (self-directed professional development) annually.
Enjoy a flexible schedule of full-time hours, health/dental benefits and private US coverage.
Work from a modern, ergonomic space complete with standing/sitting desks and an open-concept social atmosphere.

Compensation

We are searching for an Associate Director of Voice and AI Professional Services to lead our teams working with Google, Amazon, IBM and other emerging Voice and Artificial Intelligence partners. Together, we can define the future of technology-augmented workplace and customer experiences.


As an Associate Director at Myplanet, you'll mentor, critique, and foster growth for a group of 10 - 15 developers embedded on several multidisciplinary teams within a 50-person unit. You'll coach others to deliver amazing work, build relationships with customers, and foster a strong technology culture. You'll work as a member of our Extended Leadership Team to grow accounts and win new business. You'll wear various hats and let your entrepreneurial spirit fly (or run, or swim, or teleport...) It's a tall, incredibly rewarding order.


About You


Alongside our Client Services and Design leaders, here is how you'll spend your time:
50% - Build strategic relationships with new customers, help define customer technology strategy and vision, and scope & pitch our work together, contributing directly toward our quarterly bookings objectives. Define business strategy as a tech thinker: continuously examine and assess Myplanet's technology services, explore new competitive offerings, and build capabilities.
25% - Support our delivery teams: provide technical guidance, critique, and mentorship to help your team deliver the best possible work for our customers. Be ready to roll up your sleeves where necessary to provide hands-on support.

10% - Plan & communicate: Provide insight into the health of your team and projects, and plan effective assignments that match the interests and expertise of your staff.
What this Role is NOT
A traditional 'approve everything' engineering manager role.
A management role which is fully unbilled; i.e. you'll still have some time allocated to direct involvement in a few projects as a technology leader.
Is the role a fit for you?


The Associate Director, Voice and AI Professional Services role emphasizes team collaboration, technology strategy and business acumen, as well as functional leadership in your area of expertise. We value leaders with a maker's attitude, collaborative energy, and entrepreneurial spirit. You'll find fulfillment in the role if you
Delight in making things. You thrill at the concept of helping teams deliver a concrete product, not merely a strategy or concept. You have an eye for detail and know how to get the highest performance out of technologists. You've got a solid handle on building enterprise web and mobile applications.
Find passion in learning new things. You relish every opportunity to move things forward with your can-do attitude and you eagerly share your entrepreneurial spark. You like depth, but if you only have time to skim the surface, you can get up to speed quickly and think critically about what you've learned.
Thoroughly enjoy collaborative work and servant leadership. You enjoy knowledge sharing in all directions and you geek out at the chance to improve skills across disciplines for you and your teammates. You genuinely care about what makes people tick, and you're committed to helping others succeed by putting the team's needs first.
You have an interest in making the business work. You're an entrepreneur at heart. You see technology as a tool that can solve business challenges. You're willing to wear different hats to move the business forward.
Qualifications
A college or university degree in a related discipline preferable.
Demonstrated ability to scope, pitch and close business with enterprise customers.
Minimum 7 - 10 years industry experience in enterprise web and mobile development with a minimum of 3 years in a leadership role.
Demonstrated background with voice interfaces (frameworks such as Alexa Skills Kit, Google Dialogflow or MS Bot Framework) or creation of custom Conversational AI
Ideally experience managing teams using a modern technology stack, including cloud infrastructure, full-stack JavaScript and using agile project delivery methodologies.
Ability to travel to meet customers, partners and our community (10-25%).
Performance & Growth Expectations
Your work as a technology team leader will be measured using our 360-degree system (a combination of peer and supervisor feedback) and through evaluation of responsibility fulfilment.
Your growth path in your functional domain will be primarily your own responsibility to define, based on what you hope to achieve and how you choose to access the resources available to you.
Your work will also be measured on the basis of a semi-annual KPI set cooperatively with our leadership team.
Benefits & Perks
Explore ongoing opportunities for professional development: training, conferences, certifications, and in-house peer mentorship.
Experiment with new techniques, wear multiple hats, and learn about new disciplines. Our environment is not your average, hierarchical software studio: we emphasize accountability for outcomes, but autonomy in activities.
Pursue independent projects, explore new ideas, and challenge yourself to become a thought leader in your field with 5 days of dedicated ""Awesome time"" (self-directed professional development) annually.
Enjoy a flexible schedule of full-time hours, health/dental benefits and private US coverage.
Work from a modern, ergonomic space complete with standing/sitting desks and an open-concept social atmosphere.
Compensation


This role features a competitive base salary; benefits; and a commission-based booking incentive, tied to your book of business; as well as participation in our Employee Stock Option Plan.

As an Associate Director at Myplanet, you'll mentor, critique, and foster growth for a group of 10 - 15 developers embedded on several multidisciplinary teams within a 50-person unit. You'll coach others to deliver amazing work, build relationships with customers, and foster a strong technology culture. You'll work as a member of our Extended Leadership Team to grow accounts and win new business. You'll wear various hats and let your entrepreneurial spirit fly (or run, or swim, or teleport...) It's a tall, incredibly rewarding order.


About You


Alongside our Client Services and Design leaders, here is how you'll spend your time:
50% - Build strategic relationships with new customers, help define customer technology strategy and vision, and scope & pitch our work together, contributing directly toward our quarterly bookings objectives. Define business strategy as a tech thinker: continuously examine and assess Myplanet's technology services, explore new competitive offerings, and build capabilities.

10% - Plan & communicate: Provide insight into the health of your team and projects, and plan effective assignments that match the interests and expertise of your staff.
What this Role is NOT
A traditional 'approve everything' engineering manager role.
A management role which is fully unbilled; i.e. you'll still have some time allocated to direct involvement in a few projects as a technology leader.
Is the role a fit for you?


The Associate Director, Voice and AI Professional Services role emphasizes team collaboration, technology strategy and business acumen, as well as functional leadership in your area of expertise. We value leaders with a maker's attitude, collaborative energy, and entrepreneurial spirit. You'll find fulfillment in the role if you
Delight in making things. You thrill at the concept of helping teams deliver a concrete product, not merely a strategy or concept. You have an eye for detail and know how to get the highest performance out of technologists. You've got a solid handle on building enterprise web and mobile applications.
Find passion in learning new things. You relish every opportunity to move things forward with your can-do attitude and you eagerly share your entrepreneurial spark. You like depth, but if you only have time to skim the surface, you can get up to speed quickly and think critically about what you've learned.
Thoroughly enjoy collaborative work and servant leadership. You enjoy knowledge sharing in all directions and you geek out at the chance to improve skills across disciplines for you and your teammates. You genuinely care about what makes people tick, and you're committed to helping others succeed by putting the team's needs first.
You have an interest in making the business work. You're an entrepreneur at heart. You see technology as a tool that can solve business challenges. You're willing to wear different hats to move the business forward.
Qualifications
A college or university degree in a related discipline preferable.
Demonstrated ability to scope, pitch and close business with enterprise customers.
Minimum 7 - 10 years industry experience in enterprise web and mobile development with a minimum of 3 years in a leadership role.
Demonstrated background with voice interfaces (frameworks such as Alexa Skills Kit, Google Dialogflow or MS Bot Framework) or creation of custom Conversational AI
Ideally experience managing teams using a modern technology stack, including cloud infrastructure, full-stack JavaScript and using agile project delivery methodologies.
Ability to travel to meet customers, partners and our community (10-25%).
Performance & Growth Expectations
Your work as a technology team leader will be measured using our 360-degree system (a combination of peer and supervisor feedback) and through evaluation of responsibility fulfilment.
Your growth path in your functional domain will be primarily your own responsibility to define, based on what you hope to achieve and how you choose to access the resources available to you.
Your work will also be measured on the basis of a semi-annual KPI set cooperatively with our leadership team.
Benefits & Perks
Explore ongoing opportunities for professional development: training, conferences, certifications, and in-house peer mentorship.
Experiment with new techniques, wear multiple hats, and learn about new disciplines. Our environment is not your average, hierarchical software studio: we emphasize accountability for outcomes, but autonomy in activities.
Pursue independent projects, explore new ideas, and challenge yourself to become a thought leader in your field with 5 days of dedicated ""Awesome time"" (self-directed professional development) annually.
Enjoy a flexible schedule of full-time hours, health/dental benefits and private US coverage.
Work from a modern, ergonomic space complete with standing/sitting desks and an open-concept social atmosphere.
Compensation


This role features a competitive base salary; benefits; and a commission-based booking incentive, tied to your book of business; as well as participation in our Employee Stock Option Plan.

50% - Build strategic relationships with new customers, help define customer technology strategy and vision, and scope & pitch our work together, contributing directly toward our quarterly bookings objectives. Define business strategy as a tech thinker: continuously examine and assess Myplanet's technology services, explore new competitive offerings, and build capabilities.

What this Role is NOT
A traditional 'approve everything' engineering manager role.
A management role which is fully unbilled; i.e. you'll still have some time allocated to direct involvement in a few projects as a technology leader.
Is the role a fit for you?


The Associate Director, Voice and AI Professional Services role emphasizes team collaboration, technology strategy and business acumen, as well as functional leadership in your area of expertise. We value leaders with a maker's attitude, collaborative energy, and entrepreneurial spirit. You'll find fulfillment in the role if you
Delight in making things. You thrill at the concept of helping teams deliver a concrete product, not merely a strategy or concept. You have an eye for detail and know how to get the highest performance out of technologists. You've got a solid handle on building enterprise web and mobile applications.
Find passion in learning new things. You relish every opportunity to move things forward with your can-do attitude and you eagerly share your entrepreneurial spark. You like depth, but if you only have time to skim the surface, you can get up to speed quickly and think critically about what you've learned.
Thoroughly enjoy collaborative work and servant leadership. You enjoy knowledge sharing in all directions and you geek out at the chance to improve skills across disciplines for you and your teammates. You genuinely care about what makes people tick, and you're committed to helping others succeed by putting the team's needs first.
You have an interest in making the business work. You're an entrepreneur at heart. You see technology as a tool that can solve business challenges. You're willing to wear different hats to move the business forward.
Qualifications
A college or university degree in a related discipline preferable.
Demonstrated ability to scope, pitch and close business with enterprise customers.
Minimum 7 - 10 years industry experience in enterprise web and mobile development with a minimum of 3 years in a leadership role.
Demonstrated background with voice interfaces (frameworks such as Alexa Skills Kit, Google Dialogflow or MS Bot Framework) or creation of custom Conversational AI
Ideally experience managing teams using a modern technology stack, including cloud infrastructure, full-stack JavaScript and using agile project delivery methodologies.
Ability to travel to meet customers, partners and our community (10-25%).
Performance & Growth Expectations
