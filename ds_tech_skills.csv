The Epidemiologist is responsible for providing specialized epidemiological services to a research team within the department of Health Promotion, Chronic Disease, and Injury Prevention. Specifically, the successful candidate will work on a CIHR funded project entitled, Cardiovascular disease attributable to nutrition-related causes: Estimating future burden and evaluating nutrition policy options for maximizing population health benefit in Canada. This study will inform policies to reduce the nutrition-related CVD burden in Canada. Diets high in sodium and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) are strongly linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), a leading cause of mortality. Given their high prevalence of excess consumption, the Canadian Government has identified sodium and SSBs as high priority policy targets requiring effective interventions. The aim of this study is to estimate the extent to which population-level dietary interventions will reduce sodium and SSBs intake and corresponding population and social inequities in CVD among Canadian adults. The study will use data from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey, the first nationally representative nutrition survey in Canada since 2004. We will model the impact of three population-level dietary interventions on sodium and SSB intake, including: 1) sodium reformulation in food; 2) excise tax on SSB; and, 3) mandatory front-of-package nutrition labels. Next, we will use the Cardiovascular Disease Population Risk Tool (CVDPoRT), a validated population-based risk algorithm, to predict the impact of these three population-level dietary interventions to maximize CVD prevention and reduce social inequities in CVD across social groups (i.e., age, sex, socioeconomic status and food security) using CVDPoRT.

337,Senior Data Scientist,Primal,"Kitchener, ON",11 days ago,"About Primal
Increasingly, people are demanding highly tailored services to compensate for their busy lives. To address this demand, computers and software need to understand individual interests. Typically, “big data” statistical models are applied to solve this problem today, but often the big data required to compute statistically relevant results is simply not available to anyone not named Google or Facebook. Even for those juggernauts, scale is only achieved by relying on the grouping individuals into buckets of like interests (i.e. friends in a social graph). This makes a lot of assumptions about individuals, and often those assumptions are wrong. How often is content in the “recommended for you” section of a website relevant to your interests? As people demand better and more personalized attention, the need to solve this problem is a big multi-billion-dollar opportunity.

The Primal Solution

Primal is an artificial intelligence (AI) solution that can derive meaning in the form of knowledge models in real time and from sparse information. This ability to derive meaning, particularly individual interests, is one of the most disruptive innovations of this decade and solves the problems that current expensive big data solutions can’t solve.

What you'll do

You will be confronted with real-world challenges and datasets, and you will need to use your AI/ML expertise and creativity to apply existing methods and develop new ones to solve these problems in a practical and scalable way. You will be called upon to assess possibilities and provide ideas and input into product design choices. This will involve understanding your customer (internal or external) needs and and translating them into solutions that address those needs.

You will be expected to both do the necessary research to propose appropriate models/techniques and to have the necessary expertise to implement and train the models yourself. Where useful, you will not hesitate to employ classical machine learning methods, but you are enthusiastic at the idea of pushing the boundaries of deep learning and AI.

Finally, you will be expected to embrace the fact that the value of your work is ultimately reflected in the impact it has on the end-customers using our products and to find ways of measuring that impact as an integral part of your mission.

What we're looking for

You have significant understanding of the underlying theory of deep learning, operation research or related AI field. This expertise can come from extensive studies, previous industrial experience or awesome self-taught projects you have done on a personal basis. You're also a solid programmer and you're comfortable doing scientific programming as well as product development and do not mind getting your hands dirty in various coding and engineering tasks. This includes embracing modern devops principles to development and working in a setting where code is expected to be shared and peer-reviewed.

You understand that running a model on the varied and often noisy data that arises in a commercial context differs significantly from running it on a clean academic dataset, and that modifying a model or technique to work in that setting can be a significant and sometimes frustrating challenge. You embrace this challenge and may even have previous experience tackling it.

You learn autonomously and will enthusiastically stay up to date in the literature and techniques of your field while participating in the various learning opportunities we offer.

You will effectively translate those insights into convincing presentations and recommendations to product teams and senior level management. You have a passion for working through ambiguous situations, finding a path forward, and solving difficult problems.


Responsibilities:
Understand, organize, and integrate the wide variety of data available to drive informed business decisions.
Identify additional sources of data to enhance decision making capabilities.
Leverage advanced analytical and statistical techniques to develop recommendations to optimize our business.
Develop mathematical models to predict response to promotion or other commercial offerings.
Effectively integrate your findings into compelling recommendations to your business and medical colleagues.

Deep experience in statistical data analysis (linear, multivariate regression, stochastic models, etc.).
Expertise working with statistical packages (e.g. R, Python, SAS, MATLAB) and database languages (e.g. SQL).
Expertise with Qlik.
Ability to manipulate large databases with diverse data sets.
Knowledge of big data/advanced analytics concepts and algorithms (e.g. text mining, social listening, recommender systems, predictive modeling, etc.).
Business Acumen: experience articulating business questions and using mathematical techniques to develop a position and translating this into business recommendations.
Experience (preferred) or high interest in the healthcare sector.
Excellent oral and written communication skills in both French and English.
Strong attention to detail.
Excellent critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Your role at Merck is integral to helping the world meet new breakthroughs that affect generations to come, and we’re counting on your skills and inventiveness to help make meaningful contributions to global medical advancement. At Merck, we’re inventing for life.


Our employees are the key to our company's success. We demonstrate our commitment to our employees by offering a competitive and valuable rewards program.

You
---

You are someone who enjoys working in a highly collaborative environment. Our project teams can include PMs, designers, engineers, data scientists and other roles - and pairing across these specialties leads to incredible results.

You can't get enough of product and learning. Our clients come from nearly every vertical out there and you'll be able to work hand-in-hand with the decision makers in each. In fact, you will be partnering directly with a client PM and coaching them on modern product development practices.

You enjoy being a leader and an influencer. In this role, you will work with the project team, client executives and the entire spectrum of PMs (project, product, program and any similar roles that a client may have) - to progress the goal of shipping the right product to the client's users.

You bring a balanced, holistic and flexible mindset to product development. We share the overall success of the product with our clients. This means that we don't just help our clients ship features, or define and validate product direction. We do what needs to be done to ensure that both the product and the engagement are successful.

You are comfortable with ambiguity. We work in an iterative and incremental way, balancing many different inputs and constantly making trade-offs. This requires us to be comfortable moving forward with imperfect information.

We practice and teach an approach to product management that is applicable across industries and organizations, so you'll experience all types of teams, industries and products.
