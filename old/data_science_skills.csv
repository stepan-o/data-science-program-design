116,Senior Data Scientist,Primal,"Kitchener, ON",20 days ago,"About Primal
Increasingly, people are demanding highly tailored services to compensate for their busy lives. To address this demand, computers and software need to understand individual interests. Typically, “big data” statistical models are applied to solve this problem today, but often the big data required to compute statistically relevant results is simply not available to anyone not named Google or Facebook. Even for those juggernauts, scale is only achieved by relying on the grouping individuals into buckets of like interests (i.e. friends in a social graph). This makes a lot of assumptions about individuals, and often those assumptions are wrong. How often is content in the “recommended for you” section of a website relevant to your interests? As people demand better and more personalized attention, the need to solve this problem is a big multi-billion-dollar opportunity.

The Primal Solution

Primal is an artificial intelligence (AI) solution that can derive meaning in the form of knowledge models in real time and from sparse information.

This is also true on the business side of our company. Our commercial offerings and our promotion are always rooted in sound science and data, and our business decisions are evidence-based. However, the science of decision support has evolved, and we have not evolved with it.

The Data Science Associate will be a central part of this transformation. By using your ability to understand the business environment and your analytical skills, you will enable us to make better sales, marketing, and market access decisions. You will help us organize and structure our data and then design, develop, and execute analyses (using analytical rigor, appropriate statistical, machine learning, and AI methods as necessary) to drive novel insights into our business and our customers. You will effectively translate those insights into convincing presentations and recommendations to product teams and senior level management. You have a passion for working through ambiguous situations, finding a path forward, and solving difficult problems.

Responsibilities:
Understand, organize, and integrate the wide variety of data available to drive informed business decisions.
Identify additional sources of data to enhance decision making capabilities.
Leverage advanced analytical and statistical techniques to develop recommendations to optimize our business.
Develop mathematical models to predict response to promotion or other commercial offerings.
Effectively integrate your findings into compelling recommendations to your business and medical colleagues.

Qualifications

Qualifications:
Bachelor’s degree in an appropriate quantitative discipline (computer science, statistics, operations research, mathematics, data science, etc.); Master’s degree, preferred.
Deep experience in statistical data analysis (linear, multivariate regression, stochastic models, etc.).
Expertise working with statistical packages (e.g. R, Python, SAS, MATLAB) and database languages (e.g. SQL).
Expertise with Qlik.
Ability to manipulate large databases with diverse data sets.
Knowledge of big data/advanced analytics concepts and algorithms (e.g. text mining, social listening, recommender systems, predictive modeling, etc.).
Business Acumen: experience articulating business questions and using mathematical techniques to develop a position and translating this into business recommendations.
Experience (preferred) or high interest in the healthcare sector.
Excellent oral and written communication skills in both French and English.
Strong attention to detail.
Excellent critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Your role at Merck is integral to helping the world meet new breakthroughs that affect generations to come, and we’re counting on your skills and inventiveness to help make meaningful contributions to global medical advancement. At Merck, we’re inventing for life.

Our employees are the key to our company's success. We demonstrate our commitment to our employees by offering a competitive and valuable rewards program.

A fulfillment center can appear to be a chaotic place. With millions of items moving in and out of an area twice as large as your average theme park every day, a quick peek under the roof would reveal a manic scene. You would see associates, machinery, vehicles, robots, and packages flying about at break-neck speeds and accessing a breathtaking number of shelves and bins that store products. In reality, however, this activity is all highly organized and orchestrated by software, with each movement carefully planned and optimized. However, there are times when mistakes occur: products may disappear, reappear in strange places, become damaged, or worse. When that happens, how does a fulfillment center operating at that size, speed, and scale recover gracefully and with minimal cost? How do we ensure that we meet our commitments to our customers and merchants? How do we find a needle in a haystack when we’re constantly shuffling the haystack around? And how do we do it at extreme scale in an environment of constant growth?

That’s where we come in, the AFT Quality team. Our goal is to prevent entropy in a system in which there are billions of transactions driven by human and robotic input across hundreds of millions of items every year. We must ensure that the virtual and physical state of the world is aligned inside hundreds of Amazon’s fulfillment centers globally. When our job is done well mistakes are corrected quickly, and products are always ready to sell and ship.

We operate at a nexus of machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and healthy measure of hard-earned expertise in operations to build automated, algorithmic approaches to solving these problems at minimal cost. We create cutting edge software, building automated processes and workflows in the most complex operational problem space in the business world. So what should you expect from this role?

You will identify the biggest opportunities in Amazon's Fulfillment Centers
You will analyze the potential customer and financial impacts
You will work with in-house scientists, global operations teams, retail organizations, and software teams to identify new features and projects
You will be able to draw on the full range of AWS services as the backbone of your solutions.
You will join a group of the best engineers in the world, and operate in a set of interconnected small teams with absolute ownership in your domain.
You will identify ways to automate analysis through smarter software systems
You will track the realized savings and impacts, and communicate results with senior leaders

Then you discover they're for yet another social media app, marketing agency, or consulting firm. You click away. And you wonder: ""Aren't there opportunities where I can make a big impact? While I earn recognition and rewards for my efforts? And get to work with exceptional people on exciting new technology?"" If that sounds like you, meet BenchSci. You will be a great fit.

About us
We use machine learning to accelerate drug discovery by helping scientists execute successful experiments.
We focus on a huge problem in drug discovery

Each year, biomedical researchers waste over a billion combined hours. The problem is with the products they purchase to influence and measure proteins. There are millions of them, from hundreds of vendors. Finding the right products for specific experiments is tough. Researchers spend hours and sometimes days searching through published papers for guidance. But even then, many products they buy don't work. Some aren't right for a specific experiment. Others are poor quality. This delays scientific discoveries by weeks or months. And it slows availability of breakthrough treatments while making them more expensive.

We apply artificial intelligence to solve it
Thanks to improvements in machine learning, we can now solve this problem. We spent more than two years teaching a computer to read science papers like a human scientist. It decodes the information, which we present to researchers in an easy-to-use, web-based platform. They can then find products for experiments in minutes, not days, and see data that builds trust. The time and money they save have led to rapid adoption by top pharmaceutical companies and hundreds of academic institutions.

If our story excites you, let us describe who we would love on our team. You are passionate about machine learning, science, and making a positive impact. You are high-reaching, results-focused, and always learning. You act fast. You are open, honest, and transparent. You come to work inspired. You take your job seriously, but not yourself.

A bit more about us
We decode the world’s biological data to reduce the time, uncertainty, and cost of biomedical research. Researchers waste time and money on biological reagents (biological products for life science research) that don't work. This slows studies, destroys samples, and leaves patients waiting for treatments. Artificial intelligence can solve the problem, and we’re building it. Our technology helps researchers find reliable reagents 24x faster and 75% cheaper. Backed by Google’s AI fund, we use machine learning to decode comprehensive open- and closed-access datasets, display published figures with no commercial bias, and allow researchers to search by important experimental variables. BenchSci now powers discoveries in 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies and 1,300 academic institutions. Our office is located in downtown Toronto (aka “the 6”), near great coffee shops, restaurants, and summer patios.



At BenchSci we value the following:

Freedom and accountability. We do not want or have time to micromanage
Hard work. We have an amazing and rare opportunity to make an impact and we work hard to make sure we capture it
Personal growth. We put aside a growth budget for each employee
No bullshit. No politics. Just results

BenchSci is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment. All four of our co-founders are immigrants to Canada, as are more than 75% of our employees. We welcome your fresh perspectives and ideas.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

The models will allow for the assessment of each population to risk of extirpation through population decline, introgression with non-native genotypes, and by the specific habitat covariates that are most related to its abundance/presence in the model. The research associate will develop a unique set of mechanistic hypotheses linking stressors and habitat characteristics and their interactions to native salmonid population health. These hypotheses will be tested, by the research associate, using natural experiments that present contrasts that currently exist in the East Slopes landscape. These analyses will provide the models necessary for the research associate to develop an innovative decision framework to prioritize competing management and conservation methods, guide novel restoration methods and design an effective strategic monitoring plan for the East Slopes fisheries.

889,"UX Manager, Returns",Shopify,"Montréal, QC",5 days ago,"About the role

About the Role
As we continue to grow our UX team in Montreal, we’re looking for a user experience leader to help us take on the next set of challenges. Somebody capable of building opinions by defining goals, direction and strategy, but also comfortable getting into the weeds and working directly with their team. At Shopify, leaders sketch too. They thrive on change and operate on trust, leveraging the diverse perspectives of the people on their team in everything they do.
We’re fascinated by how you think, how you break down problems, and how you come up with solutions. We look for those who question, who are never satisfied, and always seek to do better and make better. Those who want to deeply understand why people do things.
We’re looking for an experienced UX Manager to deliver high quality product experiences. You will explore and understand complex merchant needs in order to build a vision for your area and help your team work iteratively towards achieving it. You'll ship high fidelity designs of new features and quickly prototype solutions to visual and interaction problems. You’ll own your projects from start to finish, and collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of designers, content strategists, user researchers, developers, and product managers to deliver the best possible experience for our merchants.
Within our broader Logistics group, this person will lead UX for our Returns team. As the UX Manager for Returns, you’ll lead your team in building out this new area at Shopify from the ground up. You will create the system and process of returns at Shopify, all while providing mentorship and creating growth opportunities for a multidisciplinary UX team of product designers, content strategists, and user researchers.
About UX at Shopify
The UX design team creates tools that give even the most inexperienced entrepreneur the best chance to succeed. At the same time, we design solutions that help some of the world’s leading businesses manage enormous complexity. Making commerce better for everyone, no matter where they’re located or their level of experience, is our passion. It’s what we come to work every morning excited to tackle.
Our team is made up of over 400 designers, content strategists, researchers, and front-end developers across 6 offices. The UX team has a special role in building understanding and empathy for merchants. We believe in testing, iteration, and in giving people the room to experiment and grow.
We’re always on the lookout for people who are excited to work on complex and challenging problems at a global scale in a friendly, collaborative environment. If this sounds familiar, we’d love to hear from you.
What you'll be working on:
Establishing a user experience vision for the Identity team and lead your team to achieve it iteratively by working with your peers in product management, engineering, and data science.
Developing a baseline knowledge in all our UX disciplines (content strategy, research, design, and user experience development) and deep expertise in your product’s problem area (Returns).
Working with the Product Manager and Engineering Lead on your projects to balance technical, business, and merchant requirements.
Growing and mentoring your team of direct reports including product designers and content strategists, with a dotted line reporting to UX Researchers. You’ll help them work towards their career goals and build the next generation of UX leadership at Shopify.
Planning and recruiting for the long term to build a fully-functioning multidisciplinary UX team.
Working with your peer UX Managers as well as senior UX leadership to contribute to the growth of the UX organization’s team and processes.
You're the ideal person for this role if you have examples of how you've:
Been responsible for the performance management and career growth of one or more reports on a product design team. It’d be great if you’ve led folks from multiple disciplines like content strategy or research.
Led the UX or product design direction of a complex feature or product with multiple user jobs.
Worked collaboratively with peers outside of UX (like product managers, engineers, or data scientists) to prioritize the needs of your users.
Managed relationships with a variety of different stakeholders to balance business and user needs.
Helped a product team achieve a healthy balance of exploring a problem thoroughly while still shipping value early and often.
Thrived in an environment of rapid growth and change.
Tools of our trade:
We work with industry-standard tools and software like Sketch, Invision, and good ol’ pen and paper to define work at low and high fidelity.
This is a permanent, full-time role onsite in our Montreal, Canada office. Relocation is an option from anywhere in the world.

Our team is made up of over 400 designers, content strategists, researchers, and front-end developers across 6 offices. The UX team has a special role in building understanding and empathy for merchants. We believe in testing, iteration, and in giving people the room to experiment and grow.

What you'll be working on:
Establishing a user experience vision for the Identity team and lead your team to achieve it iteratively by working with your peers in product management, engineering, and data science.
Developing a baseline knowledge in all our UX disciplines (content strategy, research, design, and user experience development) and deep expertise in your product’s problem area (Identity).
Working with the Product Manager and Engineering Lead on your projects to balance technical, business, and merchant requirements.

Planning and recruiting for the long term to build a fully-functioning multidisciplinary UX team.
Working with your peer UX Managers as well as senior UX leadership to contribute to the growth of the UX organization’s team and processes.

The Sunnybrook Research Institute (SRI), the research arm of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Canada – a research hospital fully affiliated with the University of Toronto – is currently seeking candidates for two Tier 2 Canada Research Chairs. The areas of research should support the hospital’s focus on Integrated & Sustainable Models of Care, one of Sunnybrook’s four strategic directions. This strategic direction is about Sunnybrook building partnerships with fellow hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care providers to ensure patients do not get lost in the system. The intention of this strategic direction is to create ‘wrap around’ care for patients that ensures consistency in quality and access to services across the system of care.
The two successful candidates will be members of the Evaluative Clinical Sciences Platform of SRI and will also be nominated for a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair.
Positions: The two positions are open to scientists and clinician-scientists seeking to pursue independent research that furthers the organization’s strategic direction of Integrated & Sustainable Models of Care through the Evaluative Clinical Sciences Platform of the Sunnybrook Research Institute. Further information on the Sunnybrook strategic plan can be found here. More general information about this Sunnybrook Research can be found here.
Requirements for a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair: Tier 2 Canada Research Chairs are for emerging scholars and successful nominees should be within ten years of receiving their highest degree. To meet the criteria, nominees must be excellent emerging world-class researchers who have demonstrated research creativity; have demonstrated the potential to achieve international recognition in their fields in the next five to ten years; have the potential to attract, develop and retain excellent trainees, students and future researchers; and be proposing an original, innovative research program of high quality.
Exceptions: Applicants who are more than ten years from having earned their highest degree but have experienced career breaks, such as for maternity, parental or extended sick leave, clinical training, or other mitigating circumstances may apply to have their eligibility for a Tier 2 chair assessed through the program’s Tier 2 justification process.
For more information about CRC opportunities at SRI, please contact Kevin Hamilton, director of strategic research programs, at kevin.hamilton@sri.utoronto.ca.
For further information on these federally endowed chairs, open to all nationalities, including eligibility criteria, please consult the Canada Research Chairs website. Sunnybrook Research Institute is committed to providing nominees with the support required to secure the CRC.

The self-identification information will be aggregated for institutional planning purposes as part of SRI’s Equity, Diversity and Inclusion initiative, and categories with fewer than three responses will not be reported.
The form is part of the application and SRI strongly encourages applicants to self-identify, as aggregated information is important to our ability to respond to university equity targets set by the Canada Research Chairs Program and thereby maintain funding from this important program.

Or perhaps you’ve been dreaming of big, innovative ideas but haven’t quite had the resources to make them a reality?
We believe that NetMotion sits in that sweet spot in between the two, and that it truly offers the best of both worlds. As one of the Northwest’s most ambitious scale-ups, NetMotion is well funded and built on almost two decades of world-leading technology that over a million people rely on each day. It’s also an environment small and agile enough to offer you all kinds of opportunity to flex your creative and strategic muscles, allowing you to make a meaningful contribution to the future of the company.
What We’re Looking For:
We’re on the lookout for someone bold, energetic and smart to lead our channel marketing function – one of the most important organs in the business. If you’ve got the hustle and skillset to take on that mantle, and the idea of having a central role in the growth of a thriving tech company appeals to you, then we’d love it if you got in touch.
This role reports directly to the VP of global marketing and involves working closely alongside the rest of the marketing and channel teams.
Here’s what you can expect from the role:
Create a global strategy that strengthens the relationship with our key channel alliances, such as AT&T, Verizon, Telstra and CDW.
Find ways to generate business and build links with our wider pool of partners, coming up with new tactics that resonate with our resellers and their customers.
Manage a significant worldwide budget to execute compelling campaigns, engaging events and inventive incentives.

Your Skills:

A good amount of experience working in the intersection between vendors and resellers. That might be working for a carrier managing relationships with other partners.

Familiarity with writing or in content production, whether that’s a stint producing razor-sharp marketing copy or time spent writing incisive longform articles.
Hands-on capabilities when it comes to putting on killer events. That means strong organizational skills and a shrewd ability to herd cats when you need to.
A general comfort with numbers and what they mean to a marketer. You don’t have to be a data scientist or analytics pro, but a working knowledge of ROI and how to navigate a spreadsheet is pretty important.
A natural ability to improvise and hustle. Of course, you’ll get bags of support and mentorship, but we love people that can work autonomously and understand how their work plays into the wider goals of the business.
Who We Are:


For over 17 years, we’ve worked with a simple philosophy: help the connected world move more smoothly, seamlessly and productively.

Signs That You Are the Right Candidate
You like to tackle the big questions: You’d rather work on an issue than an assignment. You love figuring out the complex ramifications of a problem, understanding the real questions behind the question. You love to plan, try, fail and adapt the plan
You see clearly through complex data: Within 10 minutes of opening a monster excel file you just exported, you’ve pivoted it beyond recognition, and you’ve spotted 3 caveats and know how they affect the rest of the data. You’ve highlighted in green the six cells that actually matter, and you can translate them into plain English or a relevant graph
You’re curious about people: You can harness the power of data, but you also know its limits. You know when you need to do a reality check. You are proficient with the modern marketer’s tools and can collect great personal insights online. You can also pick up the phone and have an engaging talk with a stakeholder to run through some of your ideas or take them out for coffee and dig deep into the pains and joys of their work life
You want to develop innovative strategies: When you have developed data-driven knowledge about the market and real insight into the customer’s mind, you are excited to bring the two together. You’re able to articulate a clear strategy that will effectively capture customer attention and revenue
You aren’t satisfied until strategies become real: You know that it takes more than a PowerPoint and bullet point recommendations to change the world. You’re ready to roll up your sleeves and get things done with marketing teams
You thrive on change: You adapt to the environment around you. Where others see a threat to the status quo, you see an opportunity to innovate and get ahead of the curve. More than that: you want to be the person who sparks change in the way you get the job done, the way Autodesk addresses its customers, and the way customers imagine, design and create a better world

This new initiative is a collaboration between Perimeter and NRC’s Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO), the site of Canada’s revolutionary CHIME Telescope.


The next few years will be transformative for radio astronomy, as instruments like the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) with unprecedented statistical power, come online. They will open new windows onto fundamental physics, including dark matter, gravity and neutrinos, and help to resolve puzzles such as the origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs). These instruments present new challenges in experiment, data analysis and high-performance computing. The Perimeter-DRAO partnership will combine theorists, data analysts, and instrumentalists at the leading edge of this very exciting field.

Scientists at the Perimeter Institute are part of the CHIME, CHIME/FRB, HIRAX (Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis Experiment), and EHT (Event Horizon Telescope) collaborations among others. Perimeter researchers associated with these initiatives include Avery Broderick, Ue-Li Pen, Will Percival, Daniel Siegel, Kendrick Smith, and Neil Turok.

Perimeter is the world’s largest centre for foundational theoretical physics. Located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, the Institute offers an exceptional research environment with 40 full-time and part-time faculty members, 54 Distinguished Visiting Research Chairs, 55 Postdoctoral Researchers and 92 graduate students pursuing Masters and PhD degrees. Perimeter hosts more than 1,000 visitors and conference participants each year.

DRAO, operated by the National Research Council of Canada, is located in Penticton, British Columbia. In addition to hosting CHIME and several other radio telescopes, DRAO features laboratories and specialized equipment for design and construction of all aspects of radio-frequency instrumentation, from highly sensitive antennas and receiver systems to high-speed digital signal processing hardware and software. This national facility is home to astronomers, astrophysicists, engineers, and technologists, as well as visiting researchers and students from universities and astronomical observatories around the world. DRAO staff are deeply involved in design and prototyping work for next-generation instruments like the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Local staff include Brent Carlson, Dean Chalmers, Roland Kothes, Gordon Lacy, Tom Landecker, Mike Pleasance, Tim Robishaw, Michael Rupen, Sonja Vrcic, and Bruce Veidt.

One of the fellows will be based at DRAO and one at Perimeter: they will both be encouraged to spend time at the other institution to help grow the partnership.

For full consideration, applications for these fellowships should be received before January 31, 2019. However, applications may still be considered after this date. Applicants must submit: a curriculum vitae, a statement of research interests and a list of publications. They must also arrange for at least three letters of reference to be submitted on their behalf.

The Department of Biological Sciences in the Faculty of Science invites applications for a Fisheries Ecology & Management Biologist. This Full-time Fixed Term position is for approximately 2 years (based on length of grant funding), with the possibility of extension.
This role will compile all extant relevant data for Alberta East slopes fisheries, peer-reviewed and grey literature sources. Assess the data for quality based on data source and collection methods. Develop data sets and models to be used to conduct several advanced metacommunity analyses: occupancy models, population viability analyses, and network analyses all requiring advanced and specialized skills. The models will allow for the assessment of each population to risk of extirpation through population decline, introgression with non-native genotypes, and by the specific habitat covariates that are most related to its abundance/presence in the model. The research associate will develop a unique set of mechanistic hypotheses linking stressors and habitat characteristics and their interactions to native salmonid population health. These hypotheses will be tested, by the research associate, using natural experiments that present contrasts that currently exist in the East Slopes landscape. These analyses will provide the models necessary for the research associate to develop an innovative decision framework to prioritize competing management and conservation methods, guide novel restoration methods and design an effective strategic monitoring plan for the East Slopes fisheries.

There is a special interest in both the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and the O’Brien Institute for Public Health for the recruitment of a clinician researcher to the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology with a specific expertise and training in clinical trials design optimization and epidemiology, in the topic area of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The recruit should be familiar with the Canadian health care system, large health databases (including administrative data) and be able to link different available resources to produce high quality research. Qualifications include an MD, FRCPC certification in Gastroenterology and eligibility for specialist licensure in the Province of Alberta. Specialized graduate training in Public Health and/or Biostatistics (ie. MSc) is required. In addition, with the recent establishment of the International Microbiome Centre at the Cumming School of Medicine, there is now a real opportunity for a research-intensive gastroenterologist to complement the microbiome scientists specifically in the area of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease; an area of increasing importance in IBD. Therefore, an interest or expertise in the area of FMT is required for this recruitment.
This position provides 75% protected time for research in the area of health services research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The research focus will build upon the clinical expertise of a recruit in IBD, and will include health outcomes and therapeutics in IBD. This will include both clinical trials that evaluate IBD therapies, as well as expanding upon the existing expertise in health services research in IBD, using observational study designs. The recruitment of such an individual will align with clinical needs within the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, where the combined burdens of IBD are significant.
An individual with this academic profile will align strongly with the strategic research priorities of the O’Brien Institute for Public Health (within the Cumming School of Medicine), and the Institute’s Better Health Care theme area, and more broadly with the University of Calgary’s university-wide strategic research plan. Further, the proposed position will also strongly align with two of the university’s Eyes High priority themes – specifically the priority stream that focuses on chronic disease, and also the human dynamics priority stream (that focuses on social determinants of health and well-being).
Alberta Health Services operates five teaching hospitals in the city of Calgary, including the new South Health Campus acute care facility. AHS serves 1.8 million residents of Southern Alberta, Southeastern British Columbia and Southwestern Saskatchewan. The Department provides academic and clinical services in an integrated manner across all of the hospital sites and in several ambulatory care settings.
The Cumming School of Medicine seeks to recruit and retain a diverse and inclusive workforce that will contribute to creating the future of health. We are committed to fostering diversity through cultivating an environment where people with a variety of backgrounds, genders, interests, and talents feel welcome and supported.

The Department of Medicine, University of Calgary and Alberta Health Services, Calgary, invites applications from outstanding investigators for a full-time pre Tenure Track position as an academic gastroenterologist/health services researcher, at the Assistant Professor level in the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology in the Cumming School of Medicine.
There is a special interest in both the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and the O’Brien Institute for Public Health for the recruitment of a clinician researcher to the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology with a specific expertise and training in clinical trials design optimization and epidemiology, in the topic area of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The recruit should be familiar with the Canadian health care system, large health databases (including administrative data) and be able to link different available resources to produce high quality research. Qualifications include an MD, FRCPC certification in Gastroenterology and eligibility for specialist licensure in the Province of Alberta. Specialized graduate training in Public Health and/or Biostatistics (ie. MSc) is required. In addition, with the recent establishment of the International Microbiome Centre at the Cumming School of Medicine, there is now a real opportunity for a research-intensive gastroenterologist to complement the microbiome scientists specifically in the area of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease; an area of increasing importance in IBD. Therefore, an interest or expertise in the area of FMT is required for this recruitment.
This position provides 75% protected time for research in the area of health services research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The research focus will build upon the clinical expertise of a recruit in IBD, and will include health outcomes and therapeutics in IBD. This will include both clinical trials that evaluate IBD therapies, as well as expanding upon the existing expertise in health services research in IBD, using observational study designs. The recruitment of such an individual will align with clinical needs within the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, where the combined burdens of IBD are significant.
An individual with this academic profile will align strongly with the strategic research priorities of the O’Brien Institute for Public Health (within the Cumming School of Medicine), and the Institute’s Better Health Care theme area, and more broadly with the University of Calgary’s university-wide strategic research plan. Further, the proposed position will also strongly align with two of the university’s Eyes High priority themes – specifically the priority stream that focuses on chronic disease, and also the human dynamics priority stream (that focuses on social determinants of health and well-being).
Alberta Health Services operates five teaching hospitals in the city of Calgary, including the new South Health Campus acute care facility. AHS serves 1.8 million residents of Southern Alberta, Southeastern British Columbia and Southwestern Saskatchewan. The Department provides academic and clinical services in an integrated manner across all of the hospital sites and in several ambulatory care settings.

If you’d like this story to be yours, apply now.Who we arehttp://www.rideco.comRideCo is a tech startup. Fleet operators and public transit agencies in North America and Asia use RideCo’s cloud based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses, vans and cars.Have you experienced getting frustrated with public buses and switched to driving a car? What about dynamically splitting the cost of a taxi ride with others going the same way? Have you seen buses drive around in residential areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You’re likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This ‘dynamic shuttle’ (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo’s ‘dynamic shuttle’ platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.While there are many companies attempting to commercialize dynamic transportation solutions, RideCo is the only company that offers a solution that works in real-time at large scale across a mixed fleet of vehicles from buses to sedans in both high-density and low-density urban environments. This unique solution is based on patent-pending logistics technology developed over years of research by our engineering team.RideCo’s early adopter customers include regional transit agencies as well as multi-national private fleet operators in North America and Asia.
