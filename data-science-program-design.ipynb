    "## Philosophy underlying program design\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is intended as a design proposal for a new professional “master of data science and analytics” program with\n",
    "technical emphasis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines expertise from different technical and expert domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The philosophy behind the model of the MDSA program is that it effectively acts similar to a transformation (from linear algebra): \n",
    "\n",
    "* it accepts suitable candidates interested in pursuing careers related to Data Science as its input\n",
    "\n",
    "* applies a transformation to the input in the form of education and career advancement services \n",
    "\n",
    "* and produces an output, which are (hopefully) job-market-ready Data Scientists of appropriate specializations\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, the program needs to act like a [split-apply-combine](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwiYh-zXz_fgAhXOj4MKHQQfDRkQFjAAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jstatsoft.org%2Farticle%2Fview%2Fv040i01%2Fv40i01.pdf&usg=AOvVaw24pR8THTUXR9PIgEd0ZHjG) operation -- it needs to recognize categories of input (candidates by interest and background) and apply an appropriate transformation (learning trajectory) to each group based on their starting point and interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is best illustrated with an example: candidates coming from linguistic and social sciences background interested in applying ML methods to academic research would have very different starting point, needs, and interests when compared to, for instance, candidates coming from Computer Science and software development backgrounds and interested in becoming Data Scientists/Data Engineers in major financial institutions."
